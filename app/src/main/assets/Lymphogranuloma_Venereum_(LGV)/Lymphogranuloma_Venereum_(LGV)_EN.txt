Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV)

######
Introduction
Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a chronic (long-term) infection of the lymphatic system. It is caused by any of three different types (serovars) of the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. The bacteria spread by sexual contact. The infection is not caused by the same bacteria that cause genital chlamydia.
LGV is more common in Central and South America than in North America.
LGV is more common in men than women. The main risk factor is being HIV-positive.

######
Sign And Symptoms
Symptoms of LGV can begin a few days to a month after coming in contact with the bacteria. Symptoms include:
@@@@@@
Drainage through the skin from lymph nodes in the groin
@@@@@@
Painful bowel movements (tenesmus)
@@@@@@
Small painless sore on the male genitals or in the female genital tract
@@@@@@
Swelling and redness of the skin in the groin area
@@@@@@
Swelling of the labia (in women)
@@@@@@
Swollen groin lymph nodes on one or both sides; it may also affect lymph nodes around the rectum in people who have anal intercourse
@@@@@@
Blood or pus from the rectum (blood in the stools)
@@@@@@
The infection can cause diarrhea and lower abdominal pain.
The health care provider will examine you and ask about your medical and sexual history.

######
Test And Diagnosis
@@@@@@
Biopsy of the lymph node
@@@@@@
Blood test for the bacteria that causes LGV
@@@@@@
Laboratory test to detect chlamydia

######
Treatment
The complete treatment of patients with LGV includes appropriate antimicrobial coverage and drainage of infected buboes.
###
The recommended medical treatment for LGV involves one of the following antibiotic regimens:
@@@@@@
Doxycycline 100mg PO bid for 21 d
@@@@@@
Erythromycin base 500mg PO qid for 21 d
Doxycycline is the drug of choice in patients who are not pregnant. Pregnant and lactating females should be treated with erythromycin. HIV-positive patients should be treated the same as HIV-negative patients, although they may require prolonged treatment, with longer resolution of symptoms

######
Complications
@@@@@@
Abnormal connections between the rectum and vagina (fistula)
@@@@@@
Brain inflammation (encephalitis - very rare)
@@@@@@
Infections in the joints, eyes, heart, or liver
@@@@@@

######
Prevention
@@@@@@
Not having any sexual activity is the only way to prevent a sexually transmitted infection. Safer sex behaviors may reduce the risk.

The proper use of condoms, either the male or female type, greatly decreases the risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection. You need to wear the condom from the beginning to the end of each sexual activity
