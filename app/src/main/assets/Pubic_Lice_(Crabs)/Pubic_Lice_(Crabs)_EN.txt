Pubic Lice (Crabs)

######
Introduction
Pubic lice - also known as crabs - are small parasites that attach to the skin and hair near your genitals. Crabs aren't dangerous, and they're usually pretty easy to get rid of
Millions of people get infected with pubic lice every year. They are tiny insects that look like tiny versions of the crabs you see at the beach. They live on the skin and coarse hairs that are around your genitals, and they feed on your blood. Pubic lice spread really easily during sexual contact.
Pubic lice symptoms include pretty intense itching. But even though pubic lice can be uncomfortable, they don't cause any serious health problems. It's usually easy to get rid of them with over-the-counter medicines.
Getting pubic lice doesn't mean you're dirty - it has nothing to do with hygiene or cleanliness. Anybody can get pubic lice if they have close, personal contact with someone who has them. About 3 million people in the U.S. get pubic lice every year.

######
Sign And Symptoms
Usually, the symptoms of pubic lice start about 5 days after you get them. Some people never have symptoms, or they think the symptoms are caused by something else (like a rash).
###
The most common symptom of pubic lice is intense itching in your pubic area. The itching and irritation is caused by your body's reaction to the crab's bites.
@@@@@@
Lots of itching in your genital area.
@@@@@@
Super small bugs in your pubic hair. You can usually see pubic lice by looking closely, or you may need to use a magnifying glass. Pubic lice are tan or whitish-gray, and they look like tiny crabs. They get darker when they're full of blood.
@@@@@@
Crab eggs (called nits) on the bottom part of your pubic hairs. Nits are really small and can be hard to see. They're oval and yellow, white, or pearly. Nits usually come in clumps.
@@@@@@
Dark or bluish spots on the skin where pubic lice are living. These spots come from the crab's bites.
@@@@@@
Feeling feverish, run-down, or irritable.
Crabs usually hang out in your pubic hair around your genitals, which is why it's easy to get them from sex. But crabs can sometimes end up in other kinds of coarse hair, like your eyelashes, eyebrows, chest hair, armpits, beard, or mustache. It's really, really rare to get pubic lice in the hair on top of your head.

Test And Diagnosis
Examination to look for small grey white oval eggs attach to the hart shafts in the outer genital area. Scratch mark or sign of an infection such as impetigo. eye lashes should be viewed with high powered magnifying glass

Treatment
Pubic lice treatments are easy to use and come in gels, shampoos, liquids, and foam. Most are sold over-the-counter in drugstores, so you can buy them without getting a prescription from a doctor first. Common brands are A-200, Rid, and Nix. Follow the directions that come in the package carefully. You may need to use the treatment more than once.
You can get stronger medicines for pubic lice with a prescription. If you have lice in your eyebrows or eyelashes, you need a special kind of treatment that you can only get from your doctor. If you&rsquo;re pregnant or breastfeeding, talk to your doctor before using any treatment.
Anyone you've had intimate contact with should treat themselves at the same time, so you don't pass crabs back and forth. Always use freshly-washed clothes, towels, and bedding after you finish treatment.
The only thing that will actually get rid of your crabs for good are medicines meant to kill pubic lice. Home remedies like hot baths or shaving don't work. Treatments that soothe itching (like hydrocortisone cream) can help you feel better, but they won't cure your pubic lice

Complications
@@@@@@
secondary infection due to scratching
@@@@@@
Eye irritation may lead to development of pink eye
@@@@@@
Discolouration of skin where pubic lice continue feeding

######
Prevention
Crabs are easily spread during sex, even if you use condoms. The only 100% sure way to prevent pubic lice is to not have intimate contact.
Crabs are pretty contagious and spread easily when people's genitals and pubic hair rub together. So the only definite way to prevent crabs is to not have sex.
Crabs may seem kind of scary, especially because they spread easily. But try not to stress out too much about getting them. The good news is pubic lice are easy to treat and don't cause serious health problems.
Condoms are super great at preventing other STDs (like HIV), but they don't protect you from crabs. It's still important to have safer sex by using condoms and getting tested for STDs regularly, so you can stay healthy.
If someone you know has crabs, avoid sharing clothes, towels, and beds with them until they finish treatment and wash all their stuff. If you've had sex with them in the previous month, use treatment to make sure you don't pass crabs back and forth between you.
