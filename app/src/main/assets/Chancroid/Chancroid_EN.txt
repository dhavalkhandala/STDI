Chancroid

######
Introduction
Chancroid is a bacterial infection that causes open sores on or around the genitals of men and women. It is a type of venereal disease (transmitted through sexual contact) that is rarely seen in the United States. It mostly occurs in developing countries, particularly in the Global South.
The bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid. It attacks the tissue and produces an open sore (sometimes referred to as a chancroid or ulcer) on or near the external reproductive organs of men and women. The ulcer may bleed or produce a contagious fluid that can spread bacteria during oral, anal, or vaginal intercourse. Chancroid may also spread from skin-to-skin contact with an infected person

######
Sign And Symptoms
Chancroid symptoms usually appear about 4-10 days after infection. Chancroid symptoms may include
Open sores, usually on the penis, rectum, and vulva - especially around the opening to the vagina. Sores may produce pus and be painful.
Swollen glands in the groin

######
Test And Diagnosis
Diagnosing the condition may involve taking samples of the fluid that drains from the sore. These samples are sent to a laboratory for analysis. Diagnosing chancroid is currently not possible through blood testing. Your physician may also examine the lymph nodes in your groin for swelling and pain.

######
Treatment
Chancroid may be successfully treated with medication. It may go away on its own, but it may take several months to completely clear up. Medication is often faster and more productive.
###
For the treatment of chancroid, the CDC recommends antibiotic therapy from 1 of 4 equally efficacious agents, as follows
@@@@@@
Azithromycin - 1g orally (PO) as a single dose
@@@@@@
Ceftriaxone - 250mg intramuscularly as a single dose
@@@@@@
Erythromycin base - 500mg PO 3 times daily for 7 days
@@@@@@
Ciprofloxacin - 500mg PO twice daily for 3 days
Ceftriaxone is the treatment of choice in pregnant women
Symptomatic improvement should occur within days of treatment. Ulcers should show objective signs of improvement within about a week of treatment.

######
Complications
Complications include urethral fistulas and scars on the foreskin of the penis in uncircumcised males. Patients with chancroid should also be checked for other sexually transmitted infections, including syphilis, HIV, and genital herpes.

######
Prevention
@@@@@@
You can abstain from vaginal and anal intercourse, and oral sex.
@@@@@@
If you choose to have vaginal or anal intercourse, use female or latex condoms every time.
@@@@@@
If you choose to have oral sex, use a condom, Glyde dam, or dental dam.
@@@@@@
Avoid touching the chancroid sores. If you do touch one, carefully wash your hands to reduce the risk that you spread the infection to another part of your body.
