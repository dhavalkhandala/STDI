Scabies

######
Introduction
Scabies is an itchy, highly contagious skin disease caused by an infestation by the itch mite Sarcoptes scabie.
Direct skin-to-skin contact is the mode of transmission.
Sexual contact is the most common form of transmission among sexually active young people, and scabies has been considered by many to be a sexually transmitted disease (STD), although not all cases are transmitted sexually.

Test And Diagnosis
To diagnose scabies, your doctor examines your skin, looking for signs of mites, including the characteristic burrows. When your doctor locates a mite burrow, he or she may take a scraping from that area of your skin to examine under a microscope. The microscopic examination can determine the presence of mites or their eggs.

######
Treatment
The medicine is applied at night, when the mites are most active. It is washed off the following morning. You should make sure to strictly follow your doctors instructions regarding treatment.
###
According to the American Academy of Dermotologists (AAD), some common topical medicines used to treat scabies include:
@@@@@@
5 percent permethian cream (most common treatment)
@@@@@@
25 percent benzyl benzoate lotion
@@@@@@
10 percent sulfur ointment
@@@@@@
10 percent crotamiton cream
@@@@@@
1 percent lindane lotion
Doctors often prescribe other medications to help with the annoying symptoms of scabies. These include antihistamines and/or prazmoxine lotion to help control the itch and assist you with getting rest. You also may be given antibiotics to kill any infections that occur from scratching your skin. Steroid creams can also help with the swelling and itch.
Treatment for severe or widespread scabies is more aggressive. Ivermectin is a pill given to those with crusted scabies, people whose scabies covers most of the body, or people whose scabies do not respond to the topical treatment. This medication has the potential to cause serious side effects
During your first week of treatment, it may seem as if the symptoms are getting worse. However, after the first week, you will have less itching. You should be completely healed by week four of your treatment.

######
Complications
Vigorous scratching can break your skin and allow a secondary bacterial infection, such as impetigo, to occur. Impetigo is a superficial infection of the skin that's caused most often by staph (staphylococci) bacteria or occasionally by strep (streptococci) bacteria.
###
A more severe form of scabies, called crusted scabies, may affect certain high-risk groups, including:
@@@@@@
People with chronic health conditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV or chronic leukemia
@@@@@@
Crusted scabies, also called Norwegian scabies, tends to be crusty and scaly, and to cover large areas of the body. It's very contagious and can be hard to treat.

######
Prevention
To prevent re-infestation and to prevent the mites from spreading to other people, take these steps:
@@@@@@
Clean all clothes and linen Use hot, soapy water to wash all clothing, towels and bedding used within three days before beginning treatment. Dry with high heat. Dry-clean items you can't wash at home.
@@@@@@
Starve the mites Consider placing items you can't wash in a sealed plastic bag and leaving it in an out-of-the-way place, such as in your garage, for a couple of weeks. Mites die after a few days without food.
