Gonorrhea

######
Introduction
Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease. It is most common in young adults. The bacteria that cause gonorrhea can infect the genital tract, mouth, or anus. You can get gonorrhea during vaginal, oral, or anal sex with an infected partner. A pregnant woman can pass it to her baby during childbirth.
Gonorrhea does not always cause symptoms. In men, gonorrhea can cause pain when urinating and discharge from the penis. If untreated, it can cause problems with the prostate and testicles.
In women, the early symptoms of gonorrhea often are mild. Later, it can cause bleeding between periods, pain when urinating, and increased discharge from the vagina. If untreated, it can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which causes problems with pregnancy and infertility.
Your health care provider will diagnose gonorrhea with lab tests. Treatment is with antibiotics. Treating gonorrhea is becoming more difficult because drug-resistant strains are increasing. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading gonorrhea.

Sign And Symptoms
Most women with gonorrhea do not have any signs or symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they are often mild and can be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection.
Signs or symptoms of gonorrhea depend on where you are first infected by the gonorrhea bacteria.

Gonorrhea can cause serious health problems, even if you do not have any signs or symptoms.

######
What Are the Signs of Gonorrhea in Guys?
Guys who have gonorrhea are much more likely to notice symptoms, although a guy can have gonorrhea and not know it. Guys often feel a burning sensation when they pee, and yellowish-white discharge may ooze out of the urethra (at the tip of the penis).
Symptoms usually start 2 to 7 days after a person is exposed to gonorrhea. In girls, they might start even later.

How Is Gonorrhea Diagnosed?
Doctors now test teens 15 and older for STDs as part of annual checkups, regardless of whether the teens disclose they are having oral, anal, or vaginal sex. This is to make sure that everyone who needs treatment gets it. All teens who are having oral, vaginal, or anal sex should get tested at least once a year for gonorrhea.
If you think you may have gonorrhea or if you have had a partner who may have gonorrhea, you need to see your doctor or gynecologist. He or she will do an exam that may include checking a urine (pee) sample. In some cases, testing may require swabbing of opening of the penis or the vagina or cervix for discharge. Talk to your doctor about which test is best for you.
The doctor also may test for other STDs, such as HIV, syphilis, and chlamydia. Let the doctor know the best way to reach you confidentially with any test results.

######
How Is Gonorrhea Treated?
If you have gonorrhea, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to treat the infection. Any sexual partners should also be tested and treated for gonorrhea immediately. This includes any partners in the last 2 months, or your last sexual partner if it has been more than 2 months since you last had sex.
If a sexual partner has gonorrhea, quick treatment will reduce the risk of complications for that person and will lower your chances of being reinfected if you have sex with that partner again. (You can become infected with gonorrhea again even after treatment - having it once doesn't make you immune to it.)
Don't have sex for at least 7 days after you and your partner have both finished taking your antibiotics. If you have sex earlier than that, you could be reinfected.

######
Complication
Untreated gonorrhea can lead to significant complications, such as:
@@@@@@
Infertility in women:- Untreated gonorrhea can spread into the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which may result in scarring of the tubes, greater risk of pregnancy complications and infertility. PID is a serious infection that requires immediate treatment.
@@@@@@
Infertility in men:- Men with untreated gonorrhea can experience epididymitis - inflammation of a small, coiled tube in the rear portion of the testicles where the sperm ducts are located (epididymis). Epididymitis is treatable, but if left untreated, it may lead to infertility.
@@@@@@
Infection that spreads to the joints and other areas of your body:- The bacterium that causes gonorrhea can spread through the bloodstream and infect other parts of your body, including your joints. Fever, rash, skin sores, joint pain, swelling and stiffness are possible results.
@@@@@@
Increased risk of HIV/AIDS:- Having gonorrhea makes you more susceptible to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that leads to AIDS. People who have both gonorrhea and HIV are able to pass both diseases more readily to their partners.
@@@@@@
Complications in babies:- Babies who contract gonorrhea from their mothers during birth can develop blindness, sores on the scalp and infections.

######
Prevention
@@@@@@
Use a condom if you choose to have sex.
@@@@@@
Ask your partner to be tested for sexually transmitted infections.
@@@@@@
Don't have sex with someone who has any unusual symptoms.
@@@@@@
Consider regular gonorrhea screening if you have an increased risk
