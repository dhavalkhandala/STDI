Candidiasis (Yeast Infection)

######
Introduction
A vaginal yeast infection (Candidiasis) is a type of vaginitis - inflammation of the vagina - characterized by vaginal irritation, intense itchiness and vaginal discharge. A vaginal yeast infection affects your vagina and the tissues at the opening to your vagina (vulva). Most yeast infections are caused by a type of yeast called Candida albicans.

######
Sign And Symptoms
Frequent symptoms include:
@@@@@@
Itching and irritation in the vagina and at the entrance to the vagina (vulva)
@@@@@@
A burning sensation, especially during intercourse or while urinating
@@@@@@
Redness and swelling of the vulva
@@@@@@
Vaginal pain and soreness
@@@@@@
Thick, white, odor-free vaginal discharge with a cottage cheese appearance
@@@@@@
pain during sex

######
Test And Diagnosis
To diagnose a yeast infection, your doctor may:
@@@@@@
Ask questions about your medical history:- This might include gathering information about past vaginal infections or sexually transmitted infections.
@@@@@@
Perform a pelvic exam:- Your doctor visually examines your external genitals for signs of infection. Next, your doctor places an instrument (speculum) into your vagina to hold the vaginal walls open so that he or she can examine the vagina and cervix. Your doctor may collect a sample of any vaginal discharge for examination under a microscope or to perform a vaginal culture test, if needed.
@@@@@@
Send a sample of vaginal secretions for testing:- For uncomplicated yeast infections, your doctor probably won't perform any lab tests. However, if you have recurrent yeast infections, your doctor may be able to prescribe more effective treatment if he or she knows the specific type of yeast that's causing the infection.

######
Treatment
Yeast infection treatment depends on whether you have an uncomplicated or a complicated infection.
###
Uncomplicated yeast infection
@@@@@@
Short-course vaginal therapy:- A one-time application or one-to-three-day regimen of an antifungal cream, ointment, tablet or suppository effectively clears a yeast infection in most cases. The medication of choice is from a class of drugs called the azoles; these include butoconazole (Gynazole-1), clotrimazole (Gyne-Lotrimin), miconazole (Monistat 3) and terconazole (Terazol 3).
@@@@@@
Single-dose oral medication:- Your doctor might prescribe a one-time single dose of the antifungal medication fluconazole (Diflucan) to be taken by mouth.
###
Complicated yeast infection
@@@@@@
Long-course vaginal therapy:- Vaginal treatment for complicated yeast infections includes an azole medication in the form of a vaginal cream, ointment, tablet or suppository. The duration of treatment is usually 7 to 14 days.
@@@@@@
Multidose oral medication:- Instead of vaginal therapy, your doctor might prescribe two or three doses of fluconazole to be taken by mouth. However, this therapy isn't recommended for pregnant women.
@@@@@@
Maintenance plan:- For recurrent yeast infections, your doctor might recommend a medication routine to keep yeast overgrowth in check and prevent future infections. Maintenance therapy starts after the initial treatment clears the yeast infection and may include fluconazole tablets taken by mouth once a week for six months.
