Chlamydia

######
Introduction
Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease. It is caused by bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis. It can infect both men and women. Women can get chlamydia in the cervix, rectum, or throat. Men can get chlamydia in the urethra (inside the penis), rectum, or throat.
You can get chlamydia during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone who has the infection. A woman can also pass chlamydia to her baby during childbirth.
If you've had chlamydia and were treated in the past, you can get re-infected if you have unprotected sex with someone who has it.

######
Sign And Symptoms
Chlamydia doesn't usually cause any symptoms. So you may not realize that you have it. People with chlamydia who have no symptoms can still pass the disease to others. If you do have symptoms, they may not appear until several weeks after you have sex with an infected partner.
###
Symptoms in women include
@@@@@@
Abnormal vaginal discharge, which may have a strong smell
@@@@@@
A burning sensation when urinating
@@@@@@
Pain during intercourse
If the infection spreads, you might get lower abdominal pain, pain during sex, nausea, or fever.
###
Symptoms in men include
@@@@@@
Discharge from your penis
@@@@@@
A burning sensation when urinating
@@@@@@
Burning or itching around the opening of your penis
If the chlamydia infects the rectum (in men or women), it can cause rectal pain, discharge, and/or bleeding.

######
Test And Diagnosis
You should go to your health provider for a test if you have symptoms of chlamydia, or if you have a partner who has a sexually transmitted disease. Pregnant women should get a test when they go to their first prenatal visit.
###
People at higher risk should get checked for chlamydia every year:
@@@@@@
Sexually active women 25 and younger
@@@@@@
Older women who have new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted disease
@@@@@@
Men who have sex with men (MSM)

######
Treatment
If you have chlamydia, your doctor will prescribe oral antibiotics, usually 
@@@@@@
Azithromycin (Zithromax) 1g PO as a single dose or 
@@@@@@
Doxycycline 100mg/12h PO for 7 days or 
@@@@@@
Ofloxacin 400mg/12h PO and Mitronidazole 400mg/12h PO for 14days.
Your doctor will also recommend your partner(s) be treated to prevent reinfection and further spread of the disease.
With treatment, the infection should clear up in about a week or two. It is important to finish all of your antibiotics even if you feel better.
Women with severe chlamydia infection may require hospitalization, intravenous antibiotics Ceftriaxon 2g/24h slow IV with Doxycycline 100mg/12h PO intially, then doxycycline 100mg/12h PO and metronidazole 400mg/12h PO untill 14 days treated.

######
Complications
In women, an untreated infection can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause permanent damage to your reproductive system. This can lead to long-term pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Women who have had chlamydia infections more than once are at higher risk of serious reproductive health complications.
Men often don't have health problems from chlamydia. Sometimes it can infect the epididymis (the tube that carries sperm). This can cause pain, fever, and, rarely, infertility.
Both men and women can develop reactive arthritis because of a chlamydia infection. Reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens as a "reaction" to an infection in the body.
Babies born to infected mothers can get eye infections and pneumonia from chlamydia. It may also make it more likely for your baby to be born too early.
Untreated chlamydia may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV/AIDS.

######
Prevention
The only sure way to prevent chlamydia is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading chlamydia.
