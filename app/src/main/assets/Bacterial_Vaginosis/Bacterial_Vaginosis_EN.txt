Bacterial Vaginosis

######
Introduction
Bacterial vaginosis is a type of vaginal inflammation that results from the overgrowth of one of several types of bacteria normally present in the vagina, upsetting the natural balance of vaginal bacteria.
Women in their reproductive years (15-45yr) are most commonly affected by bacterial vaginosis, but any woman can experience the condition. Doctors don't know exactly why bacterial vaginosis develops, but certain activities, such as unprotected sexual intercourse or frequent douching, put you at higher risk of the condition.

######
Sign And Symptoms

Vaginal discharge that's thin and grayish white
@@@@@@
Foul-smelling fishy vaginal odor, especially after sexual intercourse

However, many women with bacterial vaginosis have no signs or symptoms at all.

######
Test And Diagnosis
@@@@@@
History:- Specifically, about any previous vaginal infections or sexually transmitted infections.
@@@@@@
Pelvic Examination:- To check your pelvic organs for unusual characteristics that may indicate disease.
@@@@@@
Take a sample of vaginal secretions:- This may be done to check for an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria in your vaginal flora. Your doctor may examine the vaginal secretions under a microscope, looking for clue cells, vaginal cells covered with bacteria that are a sign of bacterial vaginosis. Your doctor may also check the acidity of your vaginal environment by placing a pH test strip in your vagina. A vaginal pH of 4.5 or higher is another sign of bacterial vaginosis.

######
Treatment
@@@@@@
Metronidazole (Flagyl, Metrogel-Vaginal, others)
2g PO once, gel PV
If pregnant, use mitronidazole 400mg/12h PO for 5 days.
Balance Active, vaginal acidic gel can be a useful alternative.
@@@@@@
Clindamycin (Cleocin, Clindesse, others)
Clindamycin 2% vaginal cream PV

If recurrent, treating the partner may be helpful.

######
Complications
Generally, bacterial vaginosis doesn't cause complications. But under certain circumstances, having bacterial vaginosis may lead to
@@@@@@
Preterm birth:- In pregnant women, bacterial vaginosis is linked to premature deliveries and low birth weight babies.
@@@@@@
Sexually transmitted infections:- Having bacterial vaginosis makes women more susceptible to sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV, herpes simplex virus, chlamydia or gonorrhea. If you have HIV, bacterial vaginosis increases the odds that you'll pass the virus on to your partner.
@@@@@@
Infection risk after gynecologic surgery:- Having bacterial vaginosis may be associated with a greater chance of developing a post-surgical infection after procedures such as hysterectomy or dilation and curettage.
@@@@@@
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) - Bacterial vaginosis can sometimes cause PID, an infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes that can increase the risk of infertility.
