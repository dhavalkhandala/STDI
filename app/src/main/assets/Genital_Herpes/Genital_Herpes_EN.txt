Genital Herpes

######
Introduction
Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can cause sores on your genital or rectal area, buttocks, and thighs. You can get it from having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has it. The virus can spread even when sores are not present. Mothers can also infect their babies during childbirth.
Symptoms of herpes are called outbreaks. You usually get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. The sores are blisters which break and become painful, and then heal. Sometimes people do not know they have herpes because they have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. The virus can be more serious in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems.
Repeat outbreaks are common, especially during the first year. Over time, you get them less often and the symptoms become milder. The virus stays in your body for life.
There are tests that can diagnose genital herpes. There is no cure. However, medicines can help lessen symptoms, decrease outbreaks, and lower the risk of passing the virus to others. Correct usage of latex condoms can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading herpes.
Genital herpes affects the skin or mucous membranes of the genitals. The virus is spread from one person to another during sexual contact.
###
There are 2 types of herpes simplex virus (HSV):
@@@@@@
HSV-1 most often affects the mouth and lips and causes cold sores or fever blisters. But it can spread from the mouth to the genitals during oral sex.
@@@@@@
HSV-2 most often causes genital herpes. It can be spread through skin contact or through fluids from the mouth or genitals.
You may become infected with herpes if your skin, vagina, penis, or mouth comes into contact with someone who already has herpes.
You are most likely to get herpes if you touch the skin of someone who has herpes sores, blisters, or a rash. But the virus can still be spread, even when no sores or other symptoms are present. In some cases, you do not know you are infected.
Genital HSV-2 infections are more common in women than men.

Sign and Symptoms
@@@@@@
Small red bumps or tiny white blisters, which may appear several days later
@@@@@@
Pain and itching begins within 2-10 days after exposure to an infected sexual partner
@@@@@@
Ulcers that form when the blisters rapture and ooze or bleed
@@@@@@
Scabs that form as the ulcers heal
@@@@@@
Triggers for recurrence:- Illness, stress, sunlight, and fatigue can trigger recurrent herpes outbreaks. In women, menstrual periods may trigger an outbreak

######
Test And Diagnosis
In people with active genital sores, the preferred methods of testing for the virus are the herpes culture and HSV DNA testing (PCR). PCR testing is preferred if encephalitis or neonatal herpes are suspected.
@@@@@@
Herpes culture:- a sample of fluid is collected via swab from an open sore and inoculated into cells that allow the virus to grow. Once the virus is detected, it can be further identified as HSV-1 or HSV-2, which may be useful for prognosis. This test is sensitive and specific, but it takes two or more days to complete. False negatives can occur if there is not enough active virus in the sample, which can occur if the lesion is cultured more than 48 hours after the symptoms appear.
@@@@@@
HSV DNA PCR:- this method detects HSV genetic material in a patient's sample from the blister, blood, or other fluid, such as spinal fluid. PCR can detect the virus as well as identify the type of herpes virus. Because this test is more sensitive than culture, it is useful in circumstances where the virus is present in low numbers (such as viral encephalitis) or if the lesion is several days old.

Treatment
There's no cure for genital herpes. Antiviral medications used for genital herpes include:
@@@@@@
Acyclovir (Zovirax)
@@@@@@
Famciclovir (Famvir)
@@@@@@
Valacyclovir (Valtrex)
###
Treatment with prescription antiviral medications may:
@@@@@@
Help sores heal sooner during an initial outbreak
@@@@@@
Lessen the severity and duration of symptoms in recurrent outbreaks
@@@@@@
Reduce the frequency of recurrence
@@@@@@
Minimize the chance of transmitting the herpes virus to another
@@@@@@
Reduce the fequency of recurrence
@@@@@@
Minimize the chance of transmitting the herpes virus to another

######
Complications
Complications associated with genital herpes may include:
@@@@@@
Other sexually transmitted infections:- Having genital sores increases your risk of transmitting or contracting other sexually transmitted infections, including AIDS.
@@@@@@
Newborn infection:- Babies born to infected mothers can be exposed to the virus during the birthing process. This may result in brain damage, blindness or death for the newborn.
@@@@@@
Bladder problems:- In some cases, the sores associated with genital herpes can cause inflammation around the tube that delivers urine from your bladder to the outside world (urethra). The swelling can close the urethra for several days, requiring the insertion of a catheter to drain your bladder
@@@@@@
Meningitis:- In rare instances, HSV infection leads to inflammation of the membranes and cerebrospinal fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord.
@@@@@@
Rectal inflammation (proctitis):- Genital herpes can lead to inflammation of the lining of the rectum, particularly in men who have sex with men.

######
Prevention
@@@@@@
Use, or have your partner use, a latex condom during every sexual contact
@@@@@@
Avoid intercourse if either partner has an outbreak of herpes in the genital area or anywhere else
###
Pregnancy precautions
If you're pregnant and know you have genital herpes, tell your doctor. If you think you might have genital herpes, ask to be tested for it.
Your doctor may recommend that you start taking herpes antiviral medications late in pregnancy to try to prevent an outbreak around the time of delivery. If you're having an outbreak when you go into labor, your doctor will probably suggest a cesarean section to reduce the risk of passing the virus to your baby.
