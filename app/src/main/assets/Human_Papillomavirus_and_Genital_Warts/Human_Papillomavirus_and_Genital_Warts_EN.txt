Human Papillomavirus and Genital Warts

######
Introduction
Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), infects at least 50% of all people who have sex at some time in their lives. Often, people don't have any symptoms and the HPV infection goes away on its own. Some types of HPV can lead to cervical cancer or cancer of the anus or penis.
HPV are sexually transmitted and are drawn to the body's mucous membranes, such as the moist layers around the anal and genital areas
These sexually-transmitted HPV viruses are spread through contact with infected genital skin, mucous membranes, or bodily fluids, and can be passed through intercourse and oral sex.
High-risk HPV strains include HPV 16 and 18, which cause about 70 percent of cervical cancers. Other high-risk HPV viruses include 31, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 58, and a few others.
Low-risk HPV strains, such as HPV 6 and 11, cause about 90 percent of genital warts, which rarely develop into cancer. Genital warts can look like bumps or growths. Sometimes they are shaped like cauliflower. The warts can show up weeks or months after exposure to an infected sexual partner

Sign And Symptoms
@@@@@@
Genital warts:- Genital warts may appear as flat lesions, small cauliflower-like bumps or tiny stem-like protrusions. In women, genital warts appear most commonly on the vulva but may also occur near the anus, on the cervix or in the vagina.\nIn men, genital warts may appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus. Genital warts rarely cause discomfort or pain, though they may itch
@@@@@@
Common warts:- Common warts appear as rough, raised bumps that usually occur on the hands, fingers or elbows. In most cases, common warts are simply a nuisance because of their appearance, but they may also be painful or susceptible to injury or bleeding.
@@@@@@
Plantar warts:- Plantar warts are hard, grainy growths that usually appear on the heels or balls of your feet, areas that feel the most pressure. These warts may cause discomfort or pain.
@@@@@@
Cervical cancer:- Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by two specific varieties of genital HPV. These two HPV strains usually don't cause warts, so women often don't realize they've been infected. Early stages of cervical cancer typically cause no signs or symptoms.

######
Test And Diagnosis
Diagnosis can be done clinically after visual inspection of the lesion
If genital warts aren't visible, you may need one or more of the following tests:
@@@@@@
Vinegar (acetic acid) solution test
@@@@@@
Pap test:- Pap tests can reveal abnormalities that may lead to cancer.
@@@@@@
DNA test This test can recognize the DNA of the high-risk varieties of HPV that have been linked to genital cancers.

######
Treatment
Warts often go away without treatment. But even if your warts have disappeared or have been removed, you can still harbor HPV and may transmit the virus to others.
###
Medications
Medications to eliminate warts are typically applied directly to the lesion and usually take many applications before they are successful. Examples include:
@@@@@@
Salicylic acid salicylic acid work by removing layers of a wart a little bit at a time. Salicylic acid is for use on common warts.
@@@@@@
Imiquimod (Aldara, Zyclara) This prescription cream may enhance your immune system's ability to fight HPV
@@@@@@
Podofilox (Condylox) Another type of topical prescription, podofilox works by destroying genital wart tissue
@@@@@@
Trichloroacetic acid This chemical treatment burns off genital warts and may cause local irritation.
###
Surgery
If medications don't work, your doctor may suggest one of the following procedures, which physically remove warts by:
@@@@@@
Freezing with liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy)
@@@@@@
Burning with an electrical current (electrocautery)
@@@@@@
Surgical removal
@@@@@@
Laser surgery

######
Complications
@@@@@@
Oral and upper respiratory lesions:- Some HPV infections may cause lesions to form on your tongue, tonsils, soft palate, or within your larynx and nose.
@@@@@@
Cancer:- Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by two specific varieties of HPV. These two strains may also contribute to cancers of the genitals, anus, mouth and upper respiratory tract.

######
Prevention
@@@@@@
Being in a mutually monogamous sexual relationship
@@@@@@
Reducing your number of sex partners
@@@@@@
Using a latex condom, which may prevent some but not all HPV transmission
