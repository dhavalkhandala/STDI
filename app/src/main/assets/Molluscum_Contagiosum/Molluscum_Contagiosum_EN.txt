Molluscum Contagiosum

######
Introduction
Molluscum contagiosum is an infection that causes small bumps on your skin. You get it through touching infected skin, including during sex. It goes away by itself and isn't dangerous.
Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a virus that lives in the outer layer of your skin. You can get it during sexual contact, and it&rsquo;s easily spread through non-sexual touching and by sharing clothes and towels, too. Both kids and adults can get molluscum contagiosum.
Molluscum contagiosum causes small, firm bumps or growths on your skin. They're usually painless, but sometimes they can be itchy, sore, or swollen.
Molluscum contagiosum usually goes away on its own without treatment.

Sign And Symptoms
If you have molluscum contagiosum, you'll have one or more hard, round growths near your genitals or on your thighs, arms, torso, neck, or face. They can be as small as the head of a pin or as large as a pencil eraser. The bumps are usually flesh-colored, pink, or white, and they often have a tiny dent or dimple in the middle. The bumps can show up alone or in groups. They usually don't hurt, but they may be itchy, sore, swollen, or red.
You see symptoms where the infection happened. So if you get molluscum contagiosum from sex, you'll probably notice bumps on your thighs and/or genital area. If you get it from sharing a towel, you'll see bumps in places the towel touched.
Sometimes people don't really notice the bumps or growths - they may be hard to see when there are only a few, they're very small, and often don't cause any problems. So some people who have molluscum contagiosum don't know it.
You usually start getting bumps anywhere from 1 week to 6 months after you get the virus. They tend to go away by themselves within 6 months to a year, but can last up to 4 years.

Test And Diagnosis
Your doctor can diagnose molluscum just by looking at it, she/he can take a scraping from the infected area to view it under microscope.

Treatment
If you have molluscum contagiosum, a doctor can remove the growths by freezing, draining, or using a laser to remove them. They can also give you a prescription for a medicine cream that you'll apply at home. Treating molluscum contagiosum bumps is a lot like treating warts.
Molluscum contagiosum will usually go away on its own after a while, so some people choose not to treat or remove the growths. But if you don't treat molluscum contagiosum, it usually takes 6-12 months for the bumps to clear up. During that time, you could spread the virus to other people.
Once the bumps are gone, the molluscum contagiosum virus is totally gone from your body - it won't come back later. But you can get bumps again if you get another molluscum contagiosum infection in the future.
Ice packs and taking a pain reliever like aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help with any pain or discomfort you may have.

Complications
Most of complications are secondary infection by bateria causing soreness, pain and inflamation

Molluscum contagiosum is contracted through skin-to-skin touching. So the best way to prevent it is to avoid sex or skin-to-skin contact with the growths on someone who has molluscum contagiosum.
If you notice growths on yourself or your partner, don't have sex until you get treated or until the growths go away on their own.
Condoms are super great at preventing other STDs (like HIV), but they don't really protect you from molluscum contagiosum because the virus may be on parts of the body that condoms don't cover. But it's still important to have safer sex by using condoms and getting tested regularly, so you can avoid other STDs.
