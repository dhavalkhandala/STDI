Trichomoniasis

######
Introduction
Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by a parasite. You get it through sexual intercourse with an infected partner. Many people do not have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they usually happen within 5 to 28 days after being infected.
It can cause vaginitis in women.

######
Sign And Symptoms
@@@@@@
Yellow-green or gray discharge from the vagina
@@@@@@
Discomfort during sex
@@@@@@
Vaginal odor
@@@@@@
Painful urination
@@@@@@
Itching in or near the vagina
Most men do not have symptoms. If they do, they may have a whitish discharge from the penis and painful or difficult urination and ejaculation.
Lab tests can tell if you have the infection. Treatment is with antibiotics. If you are infected, you and your partner must be treated. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading trichomoniasis.

######
Test And Diagnosis
Molecular testing, direct DNA probes, or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) - NAATs are the most tests for T.vaginalis and are now considered the gold standard for diagnosing it. With some NAATs, samples collected for testing of gonorrhea and chlamydial infections can also be used to test for T. vaginalis. Most NAATs can be used with both vaginal and urine samples for women. Only some are approved for use with samples from men.
###
Samples from women can be obtained during a routine gynecologic examination that includes a Pap smear. However, T. vaginalis found incidentally during a Pap smear is not considered diagnostic because false positives and false negatives may occur.
@@@@@@
Culture:- this test is very sensitive and specific but requires up to 7 days to allow sufficient numbers of the parasite to grow and be detected.
@@@@@@
Other methods:- these include the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test and a test that detects trichomonas antigens.

######
Treatment
The most common treatment for trichomoniasis, even for pregnant women, is to swallow one megadose of either metronidazole (Flagyl) or tinidazole (Tindamax). Both you and your partner need treatment. And you need to avoid sexual intercourse until the infection is cured, which takes about a week.

######
Complications
Pregnant women who have trichomoniasis may:
@@@@@@
Deliver prematurely
@@@@@@
Have a baby with a low birth weight
@@@@@@
Transmit the infection to the baby as he or she passes through the birth canal
@@@@@@
Having trichomoniasis also appears to make it easier for women to become infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS

######
Prevention
@@@@@@
Use condoms correctly every time you have sex.
@@@@@@
Limit the number of sex partners, and do not go back and forth between partners.
@@@@@@
Practice sexual abstinence, or limit sexual contact to one uninfected partner.
@@@@@@
If you think you are infected, avoid sexual contact and see a doctor.
