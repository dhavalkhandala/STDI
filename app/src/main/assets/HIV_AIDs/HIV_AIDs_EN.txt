HIV/AIDs

######
Introduction
Also called: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, AIDS, HIV, Human immunodeficiency virus
HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It harms your immune system by destroying the white blood cells that fight infection. This puts you at risk for serious infections and certain cancers. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.
HIV most often spreads through unprotected sex with an infected person. It may also spread by sharing drug needles or through contact with the blood of an infected person. Women can give it to their babies during pregnancy or childbirth.
The first signs of HIV infection may be swollen glands and flu-like symptoms. These may come and go within two to four weeks. Severe symptoms may not appear until months or years later.

######
Sign and Symptoms
You cannot rely on symptoms to tell whether you have HIV. The only way to know for sure if you have HIV is to get tested. Knowing your status is important because it helps you make healthy decisions to prevent getting or transmitting HIV.
The symptoms of HIV vary, depending on the individual and what stage of the disease you are in: the early stage, the clinical latency stage, or AIDS (the late stage of HIV infection). Below are the symptoms that some individuals may experience in these three stages. Not all individuals will experience these symptoms.
###
Early Stage of HIV
@@@@@@
Fever
@@@@@@
Chills
@@@@@@
Rash
@@@@@@
Night sweats
@@@@@@
Muscle aches
@@@@@@
Sore throat
@@@@@@
Fatigue
@@@@@@
Swollen lymph nodes
@@@@@@
Mouth ulcers
###
Clinical Latency Stage
After the early stage of HIV infection, the disease moves into a stage called the clinical latency stage (also called "chronic HIV infection"). During this stage, HIV is still active but reproduces at very low levels. People with chronic HIV infection may not have any HIV-related symptoms, or only mild ones.For people who aren't taking medicine to treat HIV (called antiretroviral therapy or ART), this period can last a decade or longer, but some may progress through this phase faster. People who are taking medicine to treat HIV, and who take their medications the right way, every day, may be in this stage for several decades because treatment helps keep the virus in check.

######
Progression to AIDS
If you have HIV and you are not on ART, eventually the virus will weaken your body's immune system and you will progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), the late stage of HIV infection.
###
Symptoms can include:
@@@@@@
Rapid weight loss
@@@@@@
Recurring fever or profuse night sweats
@@@@@@
Extreme and unexplained tiredness
@@@@@@
Prolonged swelling of the lymph glands in the armpits, groin, or neck
@@@@@@
Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week
@@@@@@
Sores of the mouth, anus, or genitals
@@@@@@
Pneumonia
@@@@@@
Red, brown, pink, or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids
@@@@@@
Memory loss, depression, and other neurologic disorders

######
Test And Diagnosis
Different types of tests may be used for HIV screening:
@@@@@@
Combination HIV antibody and HIV antigen test:- this is the recommended screening test for HIV. It is available only as a blood test. It detects the HIV antigen called p24 plus antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2. (HIV-1 is the most common type found in the United States, while HIV-2 has a higher prevalence in parts of Africa.) The level of p24 antigen and the amount of virus (viral load) increase significantly soon after initial infection. Testing for p24 allows for detection of early infections, before HIV antibody is produced. A few weeks after exposure, antibodies to HIV are produced in response to the infection and remain detectable in the blood thereafter, making the antibody test useful for detecting infections weeks after exposure. By detecting both antibody and antigen, the combination test increases the likelihood that an infection is detected soon after exposure. These tests can detect HIV infections in most people by 2-6 weeks after exposure.
@@@@@@
HIV antibody testing:- all HIV antibody tests used in the U.S. detect HIV-1 and some tests have been developed that can also detect HIV-2. These tests are available as blood tests or tests of oral fluid. HIV antibody tests can detect infections in most people 3-12 weeks after exposure.
@@@@@@
p24 antigen testing:- this is used alone without the antibody test only in rare cases when there is a question about interference with an HIV antibody test.
@@@@@@
Viral load:- this test measures the amount of virus in your blood.studies have shown that people with higher viral loads generally fare more poorly than those with a lower viral load
@@@@@@
Drugs resistance:- This blood test determines whether the strain of HIV you have will be resistant to certain anti HIV medications

######
Treatment
In the early 1980s, when the HIV/AIDS epidemic began, patients rarely lived longer than a few years. But today, there are many effective medicines to fight the infection, and people with HIV have longer, healthier lives.
###
There are five major types of medicines:
@@@@@@
Reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors:- interfere with a critical step during the HIV life cycle and keep the virus from making copies of itself
@@@@@@
Protease inhibitors:- interfere with a protein that HIV uses to make infectious viral particles
@@@@@@
Fusion inhibitors:- block the virus from entering the body&#39;s cells
@@@@@@
Integrase inhibitors:- block an enzyme HIV needs to make copies of itself
@@@@@@
Multidrug combinations:- combine two or more different types of drugs into one
These medicines help people with HIV, but they are not perfect. They do not cure HIV/AIDS. People with HIV infection still have the virus in their bodies. They can still spread HIV to others through unprotected

######
Complications
HIV infection weakensyour immune system, making you highly susceptible to numerous infections and certain types of cancers
Infection common are TB, salmonellosis, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, candidiasis, cryptococal meningitis 
Cancers are koposi`s sarcoma and lymphomas

######
Prevention
@@@@@@
Use a new condom everytime you have sex
@@@@@@
Consider the drug truvada
@@@@@@
If your pregnant,get tested
@@@@@@
Use clean needle
@@@@@@
Tell your partners
